                    <h2>Devotional Motivation</h2>
                    <p>
                        This website was created with a deep sense of devotion and reverence for the rich heritage of 
                        Telugu Christian hymns. These sacred compositions have been a source of spiritual inspiration, 
                        comfort, and joy for countless believers across generations. However, as time passes and digital 
                        resources become increasingly important, there is a growing need to preserve and make these hymns 
                        more accessible to the global Telugu-speaking Christian community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our motivation stems from a recognition that these hymns are not merely musical compositions—they 
                        are living testimonies of faith, cultural expressions, and spiritual treasures that deserve to be 
                        preserved for future generations. Each hymn carries within it the hopes, prayers, and devotion of 
                        its author, and by sharing them, we honor both the creators and the communities that have kept 
                        these traditions alive.
                    </p>
